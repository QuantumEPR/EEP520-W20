| Points | Description |
|-----|-----|
| 5   | Uses enviro, or extends enviro in some way.  |
| 5   | Code is well documented. Each method and class should have inline comments say what it does. See [here](https://github.com/klavinslab/elma) for an example.  |
| 5   | Project is shared with as a new Github Repository.  |
| 5   | Repo has a licence file (e.g. the [mit licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) |

Enviro Examples
===

Examples in the [enviro github repo](https://github.com/klavinslab/enviro): 

- ***avoiders***: Illustrates sensors, multiple copies of the same agent, decorations, and labels. 

- ***new_agent_test***: A simple demonstration of dynamically creating a new agent.

- ***platformer***: Turns off rotations and demonstrates how to simulate gravity, jumping, and left/right movement. Uses sensors, collision handlers, and keyboard events.  

- ***teleporter***: Move an agent to an arbitrary location. Reponds to keyboard events.

- ***wanderers***: Simpler version of avoiders demo.

- ***multiuser***: Demonstrates how to have multiple players all logged in with separate web browsers. Also shows non-interactive and invisible elements.  
- ***omni***: Shows a few omni-directional agents moving and teleporting.

- ***virus***: Demonstrates agent creation, and removal. Uses collision handlers and attachment constraints.
